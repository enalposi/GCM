__Google Web Push / Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) with Encryption__

_A quickly hacked Java example how to use Google Cloud Messaging with Payload (i.e. Encryption). Expect this to live until Google release an official library (as promised...)_
 
 Based on instructions from Google and all credits should go there:
 
 * https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/03/web-push-encryption?hl=en
 * https://tests.peter.sh/push-encryption-verifier/
 
The code requires BouncyCastle (http://www.bouncycastle.org) and uses a few other optional libraries.

This file is provided as a courtesy to hopefully help some people until Google releases an official library. If you have issues or suggestions please don't hesitate to make changes. For general support how to implement GCM please see above links and refer to related support groups. Your best bet is to use Peter Beverloo's verifier (referenced above) if you get stuck.
You can do with this whatever you want. A quick thanks would be nice if it helps and don't blame me if your system self destructs.

Thanks, hope this helps and take care.
