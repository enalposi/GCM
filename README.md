__Google Web Push / Cloud Messaging - Encryption__

_A quickly hacked example how to use Google Cloud Messaging with Payload (i.e. Encryption)_
 
 Based on instructions from Google and all credits should go there:
 
 * https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/03/web-push-encryption?hl=en
 * https://tests.peter.sh/push-encryption-verifier/
 
The code requires BouncyCastle (http://www.bouncycastle.org) and uses a few other optional libraries.

This file is provided as a courtesy to hopefully help some people until Google releases an official library. If you have issues or suggestions please don't hesitate to make changes. For general support how to implement GCM please see above links and refer to related support groups. Your best bet is to use Peter Beverloo's verifier (referenced above) if you get stuck.

Thanks, hope this helps and take care.
